# Sapphyx_Launcher
A revised public repository for Sapphyx Launcher. This repository currently holds the String data, Message board rss and Issue/Request forms. The Source Code for Sapphyx Launcher is and will NOT be found here, that is kept in a super secret location. String Data will be used to allow fellow community members to maintain translations.

I'm not ready for translation support just yet, I have a few more things todo before we can get cracking on that so keep tabs on this repository if you have an urge to support!
